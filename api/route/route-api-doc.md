## üß™ Testing Tools

- You can test all endpoints using tools like **Postman**.
- Remember to set the **Authorization** header and use **raw JSON** for request bodies.

## üìå Notes
- This API manages the `route` table, which serves as a link between `route_information` and `stop`.
- Before using this API, ensure that the `route_information` and `stops` you intend to link already exist in their respective tables.
- The `route_id` from the URL is used for GET (single), PUT, and DELETE operations.
- For POST, the `route_id` is required in the JSON body.
- For DELETE, providing a `stop_id` in the URL will delete a single record, while omitting it will delete all records for the given `route_id`.
