## üß™ Testing Tools

- You can test all endpoints using tools like **Postman**.
- Remember to set the **Authorization** header and use **raw JSON** for request bodies.

---

## üìå Notes

- The `bus_id` is passed via the URL for GET (single), PUT, and DELETE requests, not in the request body or query parameters.
- `route_id`, `company_id`, and `bus_driver_id` must correspond to existing entities in the system.
- All responses are in **JSON** format.
- When a bus is assigned to maintenance, it will not be available for scheduling.
